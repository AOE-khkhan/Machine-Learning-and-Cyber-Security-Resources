In the recent years, [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) and Artificial Intelligence have gained a lot of attention by everyone. Machine Learning is being used in a lot of fields and with every passing day, there is a new application of machine learning in some field. But there is one field where machine learning is not being used as widely as it is being used in other fields and that field is security. Perhaps I am wrong but I have not seen a comprehensive collection of tutorials or resources related to ***Machine Learning and Computer Security***. In this post, I plan on providing stuff about the **usage of machine learning in cyber security. **I hope this post will be of help to many that are finding stuff related to both machine learning and cyber security. Lets begin.

### Data for Machine Learning and Cyber Security
There is one huge source of data for using machine learning in cyber security and that is [SecRepo](http://www.secrepo.com/). This website contains all sorts of data that you can use. I have not found a better data source for cyber security than this website.

### Papers
Lets go through a few good papers that illustrate the usage of machine learning in cyber security.
* [Fast, Lean, and Accurate: Modeling Password Guessability Using Neural Networks.](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity16/technical-sessions/presentation/melicher) This is an awesome paper where the authors used neural networks to crack passwords. I’ve read the paper and its great.
* [Outside the Closed World: On Using Machine Learning for Network Intrusion Detection](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5504793/). The paper talks about network intrusion detection using machine learning. It is another good paper.
* [Anomalous Payload-Based Network Intrusion Detection](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-30143-1_11). Another paper with a large number of citations.
* [Malicious PDF detection using metadata and structural features](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2420987). A unique application of data science in cyber security.
* [Adversarial support vector machine learning.](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2339697)
* [Exploiting machine learning to subvert your spam filter](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1387709.1387716). Another good read.

The below papers are taken from covert.io. You can check out their website for a huge collection of papers but there are just too many and not all of them are very readable and new.

### Courses
There are also few courses about the topic. But here are the ones I could find.

* [Data Mining for Cyber Security by Stanford](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs259d/). This one is probably the best course on using Data for Cyber Security. There are a lot of applications and techniques given by the instructor in the slides. The course page also has a lot of projects done by the students using machine learning for security.

### Miscellaneous
* [System predicts 85 percent of cyber-attacks using input from human expert.](http://news.mit.edu/2016/ai-system-predicts-85-percent-cyber-attacks-using-input-human-experts-0418) A must read post.
* A list of open source projects in cyber security using machine learning have been posted on [mlsecproject.](http://www.mlsecproject.org/#open-source-projects)
